Usage
=====

django-dynasite was developed to:
 * manage multiple sites in a single Django app

Installation
============

Available on PyPi::

    pip install django-dynasite

Configuration
=============

Add to your installed apps in your setting.py file::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'dynasite',
    )

Get the Site from SITE_ID or host name
=============

django.contrib.sites.models.get_current_site Replacement
Instead, use:
    from dynasite.models import get_current_site
    ...
    site = get_current_site(request)

Will fetch the site from the SITE_ID setting if defined. Otherwise, will try to match the hostname to a domain defined in django.contrib.sites.models.Site. Caching is used.

Add site variables to context to use in your Web app templates
=============

Simply add this middleware to your settings:

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
    	...
        'dynasite.context_processors.dynasite_context_processor',
        ...
    )

Then, in your template, you have access to the 'dynasite' variable:

    dynasite.site  -> returns the current site
    dynasite.site_url  -> returns the current site's complete url. Takes into account if in secure mode or not.
